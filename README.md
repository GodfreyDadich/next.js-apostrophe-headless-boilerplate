# Apostrophe Headless -  Next.js - Boilerplate
This project ports the static html site over to a Node/React.js/Server-Rendered application.
- Uses data from an Apostrophe headless CMS to control the frequently updated content.
- Data is requested and rendered on the server-side for optimal performance and SEO.
- Leverages code splitting, prefetching, and other performance enhancers that come with Next.js
- G-zipping, preloading, and heavily caching common fonts and css files
